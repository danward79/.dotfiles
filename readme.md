# My dotfiles...

This is a repo of my personal dot files. Except my .private keys.

This [guide](https://dotfiles.github.io) really helped as did [this](https://medium.com/@webprolific/getting-started-with-dotfiles-43c3602fd789#.qmgph96y5)

## To install
Clone or copy repo then... 

``` bash
./install.sh
```
